## Dataset

This is the data for one of the projects run by UC Irvine Machine Learning Laboratory (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 
measuring subjects using Samsung Galaxy S II.

This code book describes the variables found in the avg.txt as the result of running
`run_analysis.R` code

Variables:

1. subject: integer, identifier for the subjects
2. activity_label: factor, indicating the activity performed by subject
3. The rest of the variables are indicating the mean of respective variables, as
measured for the same subject doing the same activity
